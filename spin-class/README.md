# Theoretical Foundations: Lemmas and Laws

This document provides a concise summary of the theoretical foundations underlying the quantum spin lattice simulation. It includes the key lemmas, axioms, and physical laws utilized in the code. Formatting got broken.

## 1. Quantum Spin Systems and the Heisenberg Model

### 1.1. Spin-1/2 Particles and Spinors

- **Spinors** represent the quantum state of spin-1/2 particles, such as electrons.
- A spinor \(\psi\) is a two-component complex vector:

  \[
  \psi = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix}
  \]

  where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are complex amplitudes for spin-up \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and spin-down \(|\downarrow\rangle\) states, respectively.

- **Normalization Condition**:

  \[
  |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
  \]

### 1.2. Pauli Spin Matrices

The spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle are represented by the Pauli matrices:

\[
S_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x, \quad
S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y, \quad
S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_z
\]

where:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

### 1.3. Heisenberg Exchange Interaction

- **Hamiltonian for Exchange Interaction**:

  \[
  H_{\text{exchange}} = -J_{\text{exchange}} \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \mathbf{S}_i \cdot \mathbf{S}_j
  \]

  where:

  - \(J_{\text{exchange}}\) is the exchange interaction constant.
  - \(\langle i,j \rangle\) denotes summation over nearest neighbors.
  - \(\mathbf{S}_i\) is the spin operator at site \(i\).

- **Effective Magnetic Field from Exchange Interaction**:

  Each spin experiences an effective magnetic field due to its neighbors:

  \[
  \mathbf{B}_{\text{exchange}, i} = \frac{2 J_{\text{exchange}}}{\mu_{\text{B}}} \sum_{j} \langle \mathbf{S}_j \rangle
  \]

  where \(\mu_{\text{B}}\) is the Bohr magneton.

## 2. Quantum Dynamics and the Schrödinger Equation

### 2.1. Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation

- **Equation**:

  \[
  i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\psi(t)\rangle = H |\psi(t)\rangle
  \]

  where \(H\) is the Hamiltonian operator.

### 2.2. Time Evolution Operator

- **Definition**:

  \[
  |\psi(t + \Delta t)\rangle = U(t + \Delta t, t) |\psi(t)\rangle
  \]

- **Time Evolution Operator**:

  \[
  U(t + \Delta t, t) = \exp\left( -\frac{i}{\hbar} H \Delta t \right )
  \]

- **Matrix Exponential**:

  For small \(\Delta t\), the exponential can be expanded using the Taylor series:

  \[
  U \approx I - \frac{i}{\hbar} H \Delta t - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{i}{\hbar} H \Delta t \right )^2 + \cdots
  \]

## 3. Magnetic Interaction Hamiltonian

### 3.1. Zeeman Interaction

- **Hamiltonian for a Spin in a Magnetic Field**:

  \[
  H_{\text{Zeeman}} = -\mu_{\text{B}} \mathbf{B} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}
  \]

  where:

  - \(\mathbf{B}\) is the magnetic field vector.
  - \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) is the vector of Pauli matrices.

- **Total Hamiltonian**:

  The total Hamiltonian for each spin includes both exchange and Zeeman interactions:

  \[
  H = -\mu_{\text{B}} \mathbf{B}_{\text{total}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}
  \]

  where:

  \[
  \mathbf{B}_{\text{total}} = \mathbf{B}_{\text{exchange}} + \mathbf{B}_{\text{external}} + \mathbf{B}_{\text{thermal}}
  \]

## 4. Thermal Fluctuations

### 4.1. Thermal Field

- **Random Thermal Field**:

  \[
  \mathbf{B}_{\text{thermal}} = \left( B_x^{\text{thermal}}, B_y^{\text{thermal}}, B_z^{\text{thermal}} \right )
  \]

  where each component is a random variable sampled from a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation \(\sigma_{\text{thermal}}\).

- **Standard Deviation**:

  The thermal field standard deviation is given by:

  \[
  \sigma_{\text{thermal}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 k_{\text{B}} T \alpha}{\mu_{\text{B}} \gamma \Delta t}}
  \]

  where:

  - \(k_{\text{B}}\) is the Boltzmann constant.
  - \(T\) is the temperature.
  - \(\alpha\) is the damping parameter (set to a small value; often neglected in simplified models).
  - \(\gamma\) is the gyromagnetic ratio.
  - \(\Delta t\) is the time step.

  **Note**: In the simulation, \(\sigma_{\text{thermal}}\) is set to a small constant for simplicity.

## 5. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

### 5.1. Mathematical Formulation

- **Standard Deviations**:

  \[
  \Delta S_x = \sqrt{\langle S_x^2 \rangle - \langle S_x \rangle^2}, \quad
  \Delta S_y = \sqrt{\langle S_y^2 \rangle - \langle S_y \rangle^2}
  \]

- **Uncertainty Relation**:

  \[
  \Delta S_x \Delta S_y \geq \frac{1}{2} |\langle [S_x, S_y] \rangle| = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\langle S_z \rangle|
  \]

  Since for spin-1/2 particles:

  \[
  [S_x, S_y] = i \hbar S_z
  \]

- **Interpretation**:

  The product of the uncertainties in non-commuting observables (e.g., \(S_x\) and \(S_y\)) has a lower bound determined by the expectation value of the commutator.

## 6. Boundary Conditions

- **Periodic Boundary Conditions**:

  The simulation uses periodic boundary conditions to model an infinite lattice:

  \[
  S_{i+N} = S_i
  \]

  where \(N\) is the lattice size in each dimension.

## 7. Observer Effect and External Field

- **Observer Effect**:

  The application of an external magnetic field in a localized region simulates the observer's influence on the system.

- **Magnetic Field Application**:

  The external field \(\mathbf{B}_{\text{external}}\) is applied to spins within a spherical region at the center of the lattice, flipping their spin orientations.

## 8. Time Reversal and Reversibility

- **Time Reversal Operator**:

  In quantum mechanics, time reversal is represented by an anti-unitary operator. However, for spin systems, evolving the system backward in time involves changing the sign of the Hamiltonian.

- **Reversibility in Simulation**:

  The simulation evolves the system forward and backward in time to observe reversibility effects. Due to numerical approximations and stochastic processes (thermal fluctuations), perfect reversibility is not achieved.

## 9. Numerical Methods

### 9.1. Matrix Exponentiation

- **Taylor Series Expansion**:

  The exponential of the Hamiltonian matrix is computed using a finite number of terms in the Taylor series:

  \[
  \exp(A) = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{A^n}{n!}
  \]

- **Convergence and Accuracy**:

  Increasing the number of terms \(N\) improves the accuracy of the matrix exponential approximation.

### 9.2. Random Number Generation

- **Random Sampling**:

  Thermal fields are generated using pseudo-random numbers sampled from a normal distribution.

- **Seed for Reproducibility**:

  A fixed seed is used for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility of the simulation results.

## 10. Assumptions and Simplifications

- **Neglect of Spin-Orbit Coupling**: The simulation assumes that spin-orbit coupling is negligible.

- **Classical Approximation for Thermal Fields**: Thermal fluctuations are treated classically, which is acceptable at higher temperatures.

- **Limited Interaction Range**: Only nearest-neighbor interactions are considered in the exchange Hamiltonian.

- **Neglect of Damping**: The damping parameter \(\alpha\) is not explicitly included in the thermal field calculation.

## 11. Parameters and Units

- **Reduced Planck Constant (\(\hbar\))**: Fundamental constant relating energy and frequency.

- **Bohr Magneton (\(\mu_{\text{B}}\))**: The magnetic moment of an electron due to its spin.

- **Exchange Interaction Constant (\(J_{\text{exchange}}\))**: Determines the strength of the interaction between neighboring spins.

- **Temperature (\(T\))**: Influences the magnitude of thermal fluctuations.

- **External Magnetic Field (\(\mathbf{B}_{\text{external}}\))**: Applied to a specific region to simulate the observer effect.

## Summary of Key Equations

1. **Expectation Values of Spin Components**:

   \[
   \langle S_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger S_x \psi, \quad
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi^\dagger S_y \psi, \quad
   \langle S_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger S_z \psi
   \]

2. **Total Hamiltonian**:

   \[
   H = -\mu_{\text{B}} (\mathbf{B}_{\text{exchange}} + \mathbf{B}_{\text{external}} + \mathbf{B}_{\text{thermal}}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}
   \]

3. **Time Evolution Operator**:

   \[
   U = \exp\left( -\frac{i}{\hbar} H \Delta t \right )
   \]

4. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:

   \[
   \Delta S_x \Delta S_y \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} |\langle S_z \rangle|
   \]

5. **Exchange Field Calculation**:

   \[
   \mathbf{B}_{\text{exchange}, i} = \frac{2 J_{\text{exchange}}}{\mu_{\text{B}}} \frac{1}{N_{\text{neighbors}}} \sum_{j} \langle \mathbf{S}_j \rangle
   \]

6. **Thermal Field Standard Deviation**:

   \[
   \sigma_{\text{thermal}} = \text{(set to a small constant value)}
   \]
