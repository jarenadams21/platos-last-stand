The vertical strip is a temporal panorama: top = start, bottom = end.
Early on: Many bright (yellow) clusters = active matter and higher intensity fields.
Over time: Clusters thin = matter converts to photons, intensity redistributes and diminishes, leaving fewer bright spots.
Eventually: Only a few yellow spots remain until they too fade, leaving a uniform red background = a near-featureless, low-intensity state with no active matter.
Thus, the image visually encodes the simulation’s dynamics: starting with complexity and structure (yellow clusters) and evolving towards simplicity and uniformity (red background) as time proceeds downward along the “tape.”
