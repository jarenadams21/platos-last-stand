1. Enthalpy in Thermodynamics
Enthalpy is a measure of a system's total heat content. It encompasses the system's internal energy along with the product of its pressure and volume.
Enthalpy is a property or state function, akin to energy, and shares the same dimensions, typically measured in joules or ergs. 
Its value solely depends on the temperature, pressure, and composition of the system, irrespective of its past states.
2. Entropy in Thermodynamics
Entropy represents the amount of thermal energy per temperature unit in a system that cannot be harnessed for useful work. 
It quantifies the molecular disorder or randomness within a system, contrasting with the ordered molecular motion that generates work.
Entropy theory provides insights into the spontaneous direction of change for various common phenomena.

## LAWS
* Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics: This law asserts that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other It establishes the concept of temperature and provides a basis for temperature measurement.
* First Law of Thermodynamics: Also known as the law of energy conservation, it can only change forms. It establishes the principle of energy conservation.
* Second Law of Thermodynamics: This law introduces the concept of entropy, stating that in any natural process, the total entropy of a system and its surroundings always increases (or at least remains constant in an idealized reversible process). It implies the directionality of processes and the irreversibility of natural phenomena. 
* Third Law of Thermodynamics: This law states that as the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value. It provides a baseline for the absolute entropy of substances at zero Kelvin and offers insights into the behavior of systems at low temperatures.
